   = note: the method `as_value` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `Invalid: Form`
           which is required by `S<Valid, Invalid>: Form`
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `as_value`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `Form`
