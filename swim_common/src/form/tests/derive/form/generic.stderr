error[E0599]: the method `as_value` exists for struct `S<Valid, main::Invalid>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

21 |     struct Invalid;
   |     --------------- doesn't satisfy `main::Invalid: Form`

   |     method `as_value` not found for this
   |     doesn't satisfy `S<Valid, main::Invalid>: Form`

34 |     let _ = s.as_value();
   |               ^^^^^^^^ method cannot be called on `S<Valid, main::Invalid>` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
   |
   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `main::Invalid: Form`
           which is required by `S<Valid, main::Invalid>: Form`
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `as_value`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `Form`
