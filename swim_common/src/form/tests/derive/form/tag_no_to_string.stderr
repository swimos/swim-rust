error[E0277]: `main::B` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`
  --> $DIR/tag_no_to_string.rs:21:14
   |
21 |     #[derive(Form)]
   |              ^^^^ `main::B` cannot be formatted with the default formatter
   |
   = help: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `main::B`
   = note: in format strings you may be able to use `{:?}` (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead
   = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `std::string::ToString` for `main::B`
   = note: required by `std::string::ToString::to_string`
   = note: this error originates in a derive macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
